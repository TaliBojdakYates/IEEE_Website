In order to run PHP on your computer you need a local server. To do this I have used an application called XAMPP. To download and set up refer to the following video: PHP Tutorial (& MySQL) #2 - Installing PHP (XAMPP)

The download for XAMPP is  https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html

Save the project in htdocs to run on your computer's local server

Open the project with Visual Studio code editor. If not already installed download the free version at the following link:  https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
